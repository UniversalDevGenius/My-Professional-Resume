Responsibilities
• Build scalable AI / ML: solutions as appropriate - may depend on the requirements and will span NLP, Computer / Machine Vision, Clustering, Segmentation, Deep Learning etc.
• Ability to understand a business problem and the available data and identify what techniques can be applied to answer the business questions.
• Given a business problem, estimate solution feasibility and potential approaches based on available data.
• Quickly prototype solutions and build models to test feasibility of solution approach.
• Build statistical models, train and test them to and drive towards the optimal level of model performance.
• Develop robust, scalable and production grade data pipelines and machine learning models to answer key business problems against big, small or huge volumes of diverse range of data sets.
• Writing reusable piece of code following best software engineering practices accommodating common design patterns and OOPS.
• Work across the spectrum of reporting and data visualization, statistical modeling and supervised learning tools and techniques and apply the right level of solution to the right problem.
• Work in highly collaborative teams that strive to build quality systems and provide business value.
• Work closely with clients, both in the Business Domain and with Technical staff members.
 
 
 
 
Requirements
 
• Experience of 4 years, predominantly on Machine Learning problems, Computer Vision, NLP, AWS / Cloud, Dockers etc.
• Knowledge of both traditional as well awareness with existing state of the art methods in Machine Learning, NLP, Document Classification, Transfer Learning, Information Extraction and Retrieval with a proven track record of applying them to real problems.
• Experience across Structured, Semi-Structured and Unstructured data along with the appropriate modeling techniques based on the business requirements.
• 3+ years of relevant experience in a delivery focused team.
